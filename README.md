# Spot Calculator

# Now works:

## Analyze
The application allows you to track and maintain the position of an asset. Works only for SPOT MARKET. Shows the current average price of an asset, its quantity and commission. Keeps a trading log that is easy to copy and transfer.
## Notifications
The application monitors the price and as soon as the price starts to show atypical behavior, it notifies the user by notification on the watch / phone.
